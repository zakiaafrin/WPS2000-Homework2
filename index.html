        <h3>Question-1 : How would you make all the sections (picture, bio, education, experience, language, etc.)
            editable from the WordPress admin? Are you going to create a different post for each section or add
            WordPress specific data types or another solution? Please explain your solution for each section and the
            reason you plan to do it this way.
            <hr />
        </h3>
        <p><b>Answer :</b> I am going to create a one page template using Oxygen plugin in wordpress. In order to make
            it,
            I have already created a "Portfolio" page which i have made it my "front page" to the template. I am
            going to create each section using Oxygen because it includes the features of an illustrious drag-drop
            interface, which can be customized and built as per my wish. I will take some sections from the oxygen
            because it has many nice builtin sections which can be editable easily and it allows me to design every
            part of my site. I am using various tools from oxygen which are really very very cool.</p>

        <h3>Question-2 : How are you going to add the project images? Are you going to use a different data type for
            the images or treat posts with features images differently on the WP loop, or another solution?
            <hr />
        </h3>
        <p><b>Answer :</b> I am trying to add the project images using Image tools in Oxygen and trying to present
            these
            images in a very user friendly manner which can be easily understandable for users. Oxygen has a wide
            range of options for images :
